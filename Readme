YouTuve video available: http://youtu.be/yhes_WA0_Wo

Shows the operation of an RGB light using a digital LED strip. 
After activating the bluetooth, open the apliacaci√≥n to control the lamp.
The program shows a hue palette divided into 30 rods: one for each LED from the strip.
Click and drag the mouse cursor to make your own patterns. 
Clicking on a rod while the spacebar is pressed removes the color (switch off this led).

Part list: wooden support, RGB digitally-addressable LED strip, microcontroller (arduino pro mini, for example), Bluetooth or USB wire.
